generator_final.pth file is used to generate the images.

As we have trained the model on Google Colab the generator_final.pth and discriminator_final.pth have been downloaded from the colab environment after training.
generator_final.pth and discriminator_final.pth not uploaded yet due to large size exceeding 100 mb.

dataset_training_colab is used to quickly transfer data from drive to colab environment.

The dataset hasn't  been uploaded for its large size. s1 and s2 folders will be generated in directory "model" when data.py is executed.
